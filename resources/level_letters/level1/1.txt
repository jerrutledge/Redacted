My Beloved Leonard, 

Yesterday I witnessed a miracle and pined for you, my actor extraordinaire.

I sat among strangers in a darkened hall and watched a story unfold <upon a wall>, so vivid that for a time I forgot my own name. When the lights returned, no one spoke, as though we had all been somewhere else together and were uncertain how to return—much like my own curious voyage. 

You once told me that the miracle of the stage lies in its fragility—that a single cough might alter the course of an evening. Here, the miracle is the opposite. Nothing I do matters to what unfolds before me, yet I cannot look away. <Light is projected upon a surface, moving images appear>. The performance of the players is enshrined forever, like an insect preserved in amber.  

Ever yours, 

Marianne
