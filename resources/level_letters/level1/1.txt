My Beloved Leonard,

Yesterday I witnessed a miracle and pined for you, my actor extraordinaire.

{I ventured forth to the peculiar place they call the} <‘picture house’>. Among strangers in a darkened hall, {I watched a story unfold upon a screen, so vivid that for a time I forgot my own name}. When the lights returned, none spoke, as if we had journeyed elsewhere together and knew not how to return—much like my own curious voyage.

You once told me that the miracle of the stage lies in its fragility—the unique, singular nature of the players’ performance. Here, the miracle is the opposite. {The players are enshrined forever, like insects preserved in amber. Thus is the magic of the} <motion picture.> 

Ever yours, Marianne.
