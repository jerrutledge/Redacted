Greetings Emily, 

As a literary-minded creature, I thought you might be amused by a few modern words I have collected along my travels: 

<‘Cool’> — Nothing to do with temperature, you may be surprised to learn. It means ‘fashionable’, how quaint!

<‘Hang out’> — On the line? Nae, my dear sister, this one means ‘to spend time together’. I anticipate our ‘hanging out’, on my return.

<‘Celebrity’> — A person of widespread reputation. I quite fancy becoming one myself.

Yours <cooly>, 

Charlotte
