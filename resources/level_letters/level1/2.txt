Dear Sister,

I write to you in a state of distress, with great conviction and urgency. I fear what I am about to request of you, but silence would be a far greater cruelty. 

This is concerning our mutual acquaintance, the so-called “Good Doctor” Shepherd. You must, God forgive, commit such an act of violence as to snuff out his life. This will prevent a great number of other lives lost by his own corrupt hand. 

I am truly sorry to ask this of you, but it must be done. This appeal is not born of hatred, but of a desperate wish to spare those from a fate I have already witnessed. Kill the doctor. Burn this letter. 

Yours, 

Brother
