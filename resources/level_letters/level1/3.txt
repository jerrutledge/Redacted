Dear S,

Greetings! I have stmbled across the most wondrous of [s]conq[/s] [s]concok[/s] concoctions—what the inhabitants of this time call a <‘Cocktail’>. It is a <beverage> {most strange and merry}, {a heady potion of} <liquor on liquor, shaken and poured>. {I have generously sampled those labelled} <‘Martini’> {and} <‘Daiquiri’>, {nectars that slid down my throat} most agreeably and imbued upon me a quite peculiar giddiness. 

Oh, I love you, I love you! It is now enshrined on the page, and I care not! <Cocktails> today, yesterday, and forever! 

G
