Dear S,

Greetings! I have stumbled across the most wondrous of concoctions—what the inhabitants of this time refer to as a <‘Cocktail’>. It is a <beverage> most strange and merry, a heady mix of <liquor on liquor, shaken and poured>. I have generously sampled those labelled <‘Martini’> and <‘Daiquiri’>, <nectars that slid down my throat> most agreeably and imbued upon me a quite peculiar giddiness. 

Oh, I love you, I love you! It is now enshrined on the page, and I do not care! <Cocktails> today, yesterday, and forever! 

G
