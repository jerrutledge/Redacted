Dear Father, 

I write to you with a heavy heart. I have seen what becomes of us, and it weighs on me. The streets are crowded with people and {smoke}; the air is thick with an acrid smell I cannot name. Cities roar with fire and <strange machines that move faster than a horse>. 

Furthermore, there is a great unease in the air. Terrible <mechanical birds> roar overhead; they drop <‘bombs’> — {cannon balls} <that explode on impact> {and raze entire districts to the ground}. <Sirens> signal their dreadful approach, urging us to {congregate in underground caves} like shivering rats. 

You were correct to exercise pessimism about the future. I feel a profound sense of hopelessness that is eating away my resolve. Sharing this with you is my one true solace. 

Yours fretfully, 

Oliver
