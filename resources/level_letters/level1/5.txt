Dear Walton, 

Life here is much changed, no more so than the role of womenfolk.

They have been quite emboldened by ideas beyond their station, breaking beyond the comfort of the domestic hearth and embarking upon <labour in the factories and shopping precincts>. They are even—bridle yourself now—<granted a vote in the realm of Politics>.   

In the field of Leisure, they appear <bawdily dressed, skirts stopping short and revealing>—heaven help me—<the lower calf>! They <dance provocatively to ‘Jazz’ music, refuse to marry at the appropriate age, and shop around for men they deem to be most appropriate in an act called ‘Dating’>. 

This period presents more moralistic tests than I had previously anticipated. Oh how I long for the well-mannered, virtuous ladies of 1803. 

Your devoted friend, 

Cornelius
