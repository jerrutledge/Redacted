Dear Mama,

It’s winter now, but there’s no snow—not like we have at home. Remember when Ellen and I were small, and we used to throw snowballs at each other? How you would scold us then. I miss those days, and the snow. I’ve been thinking of Ellen more these days—I met a woman at a party who reminded me of her. <She’s called Hedy, an actress>, but her mind is expansive like Ellen’s. I think they would be friends. <She’s been working on a new invention—“wireless frequency hopping” - that could help in the war—a truly genius invention>. I wish I could hear Ellen’s thoughts on such a thing.

I miss you, Mama.

Love, Elizabeth
