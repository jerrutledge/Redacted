Dear Mama,

It’s winter now, but there’s no snow—not like at home. It’s too hot—{I’ve had the} <air conditioner> {blowing all day}.

Remember when Ellen and I were small, and we used to throw snowballs at each other? How you would scold us then. I miss those days. 

I’ve been thinking of Ellen lately. I met a woman who reminded me of her. She’s called Hedy. She’s an actress, but her mind is expansive, like Ellen’s. I think they could be friends. Hedy’s been working on a new invention—<’wireless frequency hopping’> she calls it—that could help in the war. A truly genius invention. I wonder what Ellen would think.

Missing you, Elizabeth
