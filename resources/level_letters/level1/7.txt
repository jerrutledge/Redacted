Dear H,
	We did it. We finally eloped. Damn the protocol—we’re in love, and no protocol is going to keep us from being together. We eloped after the show last night—hopped right in a <taxicab> and drove to the courthouse! If <Anything Goes> taught us anything, it’s that no one should be without the person they’re meant to be with.
	Which brings me to my further point, H: Don’t marry that man. I don’t care what Father says. He’s a brute, and nothing good will come of your marrying him. Trust me, H. I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true. You deserve to be as happy as I am.
	Yours, M
