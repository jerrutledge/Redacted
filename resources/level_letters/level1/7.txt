Dear H,
I finally did it. We finally eloped. We know it’s against protocol, but damn the protocol—we’re in love, and no protocol is going to keep us from being together. We eloped after the show last night—if <Anything Goes> taught us anything, it’s that no one should be without the person they’re meant to be with.
Which brings me to my further point, H: <Don’t marry that man. I don’t care what Father says. He’s a brute, and nothing good will come of your marrying him.> Trust me, H. I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true. You deserve to be as happy as I am.
Yours, M
