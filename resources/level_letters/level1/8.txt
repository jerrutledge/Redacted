Franklin,

I beg you, preserve this letter until the day <Alice takes ill>, for it may be the sole means of saving her. I have witnessed a future <war-torn age wherein physicians wield a miraculous remedy called penicillin>, unknown in our time yet powerful against the fevers that claim so many lives. Enclosed are exact instructions for its preparation. Follow them faithfully and without alteration. I know how unnatural this must seem, yet you must trust me. I cannot promise my safe return from this era, but the hope of sparing Alice sustains me.

Thomas
