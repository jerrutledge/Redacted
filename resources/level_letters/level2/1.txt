Nancy,
When I left, we couldn’t be together. I have carried the truth of our love with me ever since, hoping that one day we could find some measure of happiness.

I saw a photograph from your <wedding> today, and your <wife> is beautiful. The archives show that <you and she have a long and happy marriage>. 

Please keep your courage. Be careful, be steady, and remember you are deeply loved.

Yours always, Angela.
