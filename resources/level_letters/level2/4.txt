Dear Dad,

It’s 100 years after your 59th birthday today.I wish I could be there to celebrate, but they’ve got me on a top secret mission - go figure.

[u]If Mom’s there, don’t show her this next part:[/u]
 
<She’s going to throw you a surprise party for your 60th next year. She means well, but your heart can’t take the shock, and it’s going to kill you.> 

Hopefully this warning helps.

Happy birthday, Dad
Jake
