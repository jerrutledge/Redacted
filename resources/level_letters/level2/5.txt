Dear Paul, 
Things have calmed down quite a bit since I started my garden. I know you always liked to garden - it’s so different now than it was back home. I don’t even have to water my plants myself - I have <an artificially intelligent robot that does it for me.> Like a Dalek for tending my geraniums. Far out! All it could exterminate are aphids - if they hadn’t gone extinct last year.
Happy planting!
Regina
