Dear Sister,

The Doctor is still at large. I do not understand how he has managed to survive this long, but <your failure to act has already cost thousands of innocent lives>. I say this not in cruelty, but in urgency.

I beg you, sweet sister, <set aside your mercy and carry out the act we discussed. Use the poison from the false book.> He takes tea in the greenhouse at three o’clock among his tomato plants. 

For the sake of those yet living — <destroy this wretched man> while you still can, {so his work ends in your time and does not continue into mine}.

Yours, Brother
