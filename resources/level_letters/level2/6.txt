Hello my sweet, 

Yesterday was wild. We agents met for team building in the <Skylands>—they made us do trust falls from the clouds(!) After, we ascended to {Atmosphere} for drinks and <zero-g bowling>. Ralph had one too many <Milky Way-Ways> and got himself stuck in the airlock. What a clown.

There’s going to be a crisis involving Cuba and missiles. Don’t worry about it. 

I miss you.
