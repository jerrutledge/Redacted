Dear Aggie,
Listening to some old tunes and thinking of you. I wish we could dance together again. Remember the last dance we went to together? It was us, Andy, and Mike. The music is so clear now that they’ve started printing music to <HHHD chips>. But nothing will ever beat vinyl. 
I’m just thinking back to that night. I know they’re probably going to mask this part, but I’m glad <you and Mike ended up together instead of you and Andy. Mike’s a sweetie, and you guys made such cute babies.> But it’s good that they’re going to mask me here. I don’t want to spoil anything for you.
See you in my dreams, sis.
Donna
