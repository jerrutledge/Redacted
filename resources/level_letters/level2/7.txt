Dear Aggie,

Listening to some old tunes and thinking of you. I wish we could dance together again. Remember that last dance? With you, me, Andy and Mike? Music here is so clear—music is printed on <HHHD chips>. But nothing beats vinyl.


Thinking back to that night… They’re probably going to mask me for saying this: <[u]I’m glad you married Mike instead of Andy. You made such cute babies.[/u]>

Maybe it’s good that they’ll mask that. I don’t want to spoil anything for you. 

See you in my dreams, sis. xo
