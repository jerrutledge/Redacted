Hattie! 

You wouldn’t believe the stuff they got here. I want to tell you everything, but I’m under a strict NDA. They even have agents ‘masking’ my letters. 

You know the ‘snacks’ we had at Woodstock? <Well imagine that but ten times more euphoric. I’ve felt it, and it’s far out>. 

I definitely won’t try to sneak some back for you.
