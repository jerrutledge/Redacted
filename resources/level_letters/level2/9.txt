Dear Liliana, 

Thought I’d take a moment while waiting for the <SuperChute> to write to you. The station is quiet, the rain pattering gently on the {outer rim}. 

I want you to know that I saw {your} <son> — yes, {you’re going to have a} <son>. I know you’ve been feeling blue about that aspect of your life. {He seems happy. Fulfilled. He has your nose.} 

The only thing is, I’m sorry to say, {he’s anti-revolutionary.You’d better} <fix that behavior> {before he becomes a problem.}


Hope this can make up for my absence in some small way. 

Love, 

Dad
