My dear Julia,

I had a butter tart and thought of you. The ones here don’t hold a candle to yours, all warm and soft. <Perhaps if I pop it in the microwave>, it might hope to compete. Anyway, I’ve got to run. <The Ed Sullivan Show is about to start on tv>, and I don’t want to miss it! 

All my love, A.
